# Advanced Raw Data Analysis Features üöÄ

## TX Now Goes BEYOND NOMOLABS

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Production-Ready  
**Data Source:** 100% Real-Time (yfinance) - NO MOCK DATA

---

## Overview

TX now includes 4 institutional-grade raw data analysis features that process OHLCV data at a level beyond basic pattern detection. These features put TX miles ahead of competitors like NOMOLABS.

### What Makes This Revolutionary

**NOMOLABS Approach:**
- Processes raw price data for single assets
- Black box ML predictions
- No explainability

**TX Approach:**
- Processes raw price data for single AND multiple assets
- Multi-asset correlation analysis
- Order flow institutional footprint detection
- Market microstructure analysis
- Regime-adaptive recommendations
- **Complete transparency with actionable insights**

---

## Feature 1: Multi-Asset Correlation Analysis

### What It Does
Analyzes raw price correlations across multiple assets to detect:
- Leading/lagging relationships (e.g., BTC moves, altcoins follow)
- Sector rotation signals
- Cross-asset trading opportunities
- Correlation strength and type

### API Endpoint
```http
POST /api/analysis/correlations
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "symbols": ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "BTC-USD", "ETH-USD"],
  "period": "30d",
  "interval": "1h"
}
```

### Response Example
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "timestamp": "2025-11-01T19:00:00",
    "symbols_analyzed": 5,
    "correlation_matrix": {
      "AAPL": {"MSFT": 0.85, "GOOGL": 0.78, ...},
      "BTC-USD": {"ETH-USD": 0.92, ...}
    },
    "strong_correlations": [
      {
        "symbol_1": "BTC-USD",
        "symbol_2": "ETH-USD",
        "correlation": 0.92,
        "strength": "very_strong",
        "type": "positive",
        "lead_lag_hours": 2,
        "trading_opportunity": true
      }
    ],
    "sector_rotation_signals": [
      {
        "symbol": "AAPL",
        "momentum_shift": 0.035,
        "direction": "gaining",
        "rotation_signal": "buy"
      }
    ],
    "data_source": "yfinance_real_time"
  }
}
```

### Use Cases
1. **Pair Trading:** Find highly correlated assets for pairs strategies
2. **Lead-Lag Trading:** Trade asset B when asset A moves (if A leads B by X hours)
3. **Sector Rotation:** Identify which sectors are gaining/losing momentum
4. **Portfolio Diversification:** Avoid correlated assets in portfolio

### Competitive Advantage
**NOMOLABS:** Analyzes single assets in isolation  
**TX:** Analyzes relationships between assets (correlation matrices, lead-lag detection)

---

## Feature 2: Order Flow Imbalance Detection

### What It Does
Analyzes raw volume and price action to detect institutional activity:
- Buy vs. sell pressure from volume analysis
- Price-volume divergence
- Absorption patterns (large volume, small price move = smart money)
- Institutional footprints (volume spikes with follow-through)

### API Endpoint
```http
GET /api/analysis/order-flow/AAPL?period=5d&interval=5m
```

### Response Example
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "timestamp": "2025-11-01T19:00:00",
    "flow_type": "accumulation",
    "confidence": 0.87,
    "buy_pressure_pct": 68.5,
    "sell_pressure_pct": 31.5,
    "pressure_ratio": 2.17,
    "absorption_events": 3,
    "institutional_footprints": 7,
    "volume_anomaly": 1.45,
    "interpretation": "Strong buying pressure detected (87% confidence). Institutions may be accumulating positions. Consider bullish bias.",
    "data_source": "yfinance_real_time"
  }
}
```

### Flow Types
1. **ACCUMULATION:** Institutions buying (bullish signal)
2. **DISTRIBUTION:** Institutions selling (bearish signal)
3. **ABSORPTION:** Smart money absorbing supply/demand (watch for breakout)
4. **NEUTRAL:** Balanced flow (no clear bias)

### Use Cases
1. **Institutional Following:** Trade in direction of smart money
2. **Absorption Breakouts:** Enter when absorption resolves (breakout direction)
3. **Volume Confirmation:** Confirm pattern signals with order flow
4. **Avoid Traps:** Don't buy when institutions are distributing

### Competitive Advantage
**NOMOLABS:** Price data only  
**TX:** Price + Volume analysis revealing institutional footprints

---

## Feature 3: Market Microstructure Analysis

### What It Does
High-frequency raw data analysis revealing:
- Bid-ask spread estimation from OHLC
- Intraday volatility patterns (which hours are most volatile)
- Optimal entry times (lowest spread + decent volume)
- Market maker activity detection
- Liquidity scoring

### API Endpoint
```http
GET /api/analysis/microstructure/AAPL?period=1d&interval=1m
```

### Response Example
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "timestamp": "2025-11-01T19:00:00",
    "spread_estimate_pct": 0.08,
    "current_spread_pct": 0.06,
    "volatility_regime": "normal_volatility",
    "volatility_percentile": 45.3,
    "high_volatility_hours": [9, 10, 15],
    "low_volatility_hours": [12, 13, 14],
    "optimal_entry_time": "13:45",
    "market_maker_activity": "high_mean_reversion",
    "mean_reversion_strength": -0.42,
    "liquidity_score": 7.8,
    "liquidity_rating": "high",
    "trading_recommendation": "Low volatility + mean reversion. Good for range trading strategies.",
    "data_source": "yfinance_real_time"
  }
}
```

### Use Cases
1. **Timing Optimization:** Enter during optimal hours (low spread, good liquidity)
2. **Strategy Selection:** Use mean reversion in ranging markets, momentum in trending
3. **Risk Management:** Wider stops during high volatility hours
4. **Execution Quality:** Avoid high-spread periods to reduce slippage

### Competitive Advantage
**NOMOLABS:** Daily/hourly analysis  
**TX:** Intraday minute-by-minute microstructure analysis

---

## Feature 4: Market Regime Detection

### What It Does
Detects current market regime and provides regime-adaptive recommendations:
- **Bull Trend:** Strong uptrend with momentum
- **Bear Trend:** Strong downtrend with momentum
- **Ranging:** Sideways movement, mean reversion
- **Volatile:** High volatility, unpredictable

### API Endpoint
```http
GET /api/analysis/regime/AAPL?period=90d&interval=1d
```

### Response Example
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "timestamp": "2025-11-01T19:00:00",
    "current_regime": "bull_trend",
    "regime_confidence": 0.89,
    "regime_duration_days": 23,
    "indicators": {
      "adx": 32.5,
      "ema_20_vs_50": "bullish",
      "atr_pct": 2.1,
      "bb_width_pct": 5.3
    },
    "transition_probabilities": {
      "to_volatile": 0.10,
      "to_bull_trend": 0.60,
      "to_bear_trend": 0.15,
      "to_ranging": 0.15
    },
    "recommendations": [
      "Use trend-following strategies (buy dips)",
      "Trail stops to protect profits",
      "Look for pullbacks to EMA20 for entries",
      "Avoid shorting against the trend"
    ],
    "optimal_strategy": "Trend Following (Long Bias)",
    "data_source": "yfinance_real_time"
  }
}
```

### Regime-Specific Strategies

| Regime | Optimal Strategy | Key Actions |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Bull Trend** | Trend Following (Long) | Buy dips, trail stops, avoid shorts |
| **Bear Trend** | Trend Following (Short) | Sell rallies, short positions, avoid longs |
| **Ranging** | Mean Reversion | Buy support, sell resistance, tight stops |
| **Volatile** | Volatility Trading | Reduce size, wider stops, options strategies |

### Use Cases
1. **Strategy Adaptation:** Switch strategies based on regime
2. **Risk Management:** Reduce size in volatile regimes
3. **Entry Timing:** Buy dips in bull trends, sell rallies in bear trends
4. **Avoid Losses:** Don't fight the regime (no shorts in bull trends)

### Competitive Advantage
**NOMOLABS:** One model for all conditions  
**TX:** Regime detection + regime-specific recommendations
