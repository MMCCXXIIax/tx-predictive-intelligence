### Time Saved: 7.5 hours/day = 225 hours/month

**At $100/hour value = $22,500/month in time saved**

---

## 💵 THE ROI CALCULATION

### Pro Tier ($29/mo = $348/year)

**If TX helps you:**
- Catch 2 extra trades/month = **+$500-2,000**
- Avoid 1 bad trade/month = **Save $200-1,000**
- Save 225 hours/month = **$22,500 value** (at $100/hr)

**Total Annual Value: $23,200-25,500**  
**Cost: $348/year**  
**ROI: 67x - 73x**

### Elite Tier ($99/mo = $1,188/year)

**If TX helps you:**
- Optimize strategy (attribution) = **+10% returns = $5,000-50,000**
- Catch 5 extra trades/month = **+$1,500-6,000**
- Avoid 3 bad trades/month = **Save $600-3,000**

**Total Annual Value: $7,100-59,000**  
**Cost: $1,188/year**  
**ROI: 6x - 50x**

### The "No-Brainer" Pitch

**Question:** "Why would I pay $29/mo for TX?"

**Answer:**
> "If you trade even once per month, and TX helps you catch ONE pattern you would've missed while sleeping, that's worth $200-2,000. TX costs $29. That's a 7x-70x return on ONE trade. Now imagine catching 10-20 patterns per month."
