## üß™ Test After Deployment

Run the test script:
```powershell
.\test_cors_integration.ps1
```

Or test manually:
```bash
# Test health
curl https://tx-predictive-intelligence.onrender.com/health

# Test CORS
curl -H "Origin: https://tx-figma-frontend.onrender.com" \
  https://tx-predictive-intelligence.onrender.com/api/market-scan?type=trending

# Test pattern detection
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Origin: https://tx-figma-frontend.onrender.com" \
  -d '{"symbol":"AAPL"}' \
  https://tx-predictive-intelligence.onrender.com/api/detect-enhanced
```

## üîç Verify on Render Dashboard

After deployment, check:

1. **Status:** Should show "Live" (green)
2. **Logs:** No errors, should see:
   ```
   Booting worker with pid: ...
   Starting gevent on 0.0.0.0:10000
   ```
3. **Health Check:** Passing (green checkmark)
4. **Environment:** `CORS_ORIGINS` variable is set

---

## üéØ Expected Frontend Behavior

Once deployed, the frontend will:
- ‚úÖ Connect to backend successfully
- ‚úÖ No more "ERR_NETWORK" errors
- ‚úÖ WebSocket connection established
- ‚úÖ Real-time alerts working
- ‚úÖ Live market data displayed
- ‚úÖ Pattern detection functional

---

## üö® If Issues Persist

### Issue: Still getting CORS errors

**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
3. Check Render logs for errors
4. Verify `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable is set

### Issue: WebSocket not connecting

**Solution:**
1. Check Render logs for WebSocket errors
2. Verify Gunicorn is using `geventwebsocket` worker
3. Ensure `gevent-websocket` is in requirements.txt
4. Check if service restarted successfully

### Issue: Backend not responding

**Solution:**
1. Check Render Dashboard - is service "Live"?
2. Check logs for Python errors
3. Verify database connection (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY)
4. Try manual restart from Render Dashboard

**Message:**
```
