# üéØ TX Confidence Scoring - Complete Transparency Guide

## Overview

TX Predictive Intelligence uses **two different confidence scoring systems** based on the detection mode selected. Both systems provide **complete transparency** through 5-layer breakdowns that show users exactly why a pattern received its confidence score.

## üõ°Ô∏è HYBRID PRO Confidence Scoring

### Formula
```
Final Confidence = 
  40% √ó Deep Learning Score
+ 40% √ó Rule Validation Score  
+ 20% √ó Context Score
```

### Layer-by-Layer Breakdown

#### **Layer 1: Deep Learning Score (40% weight)**

**What it does:**
- CNN-LSTM neural network analyzes 50+ historical candles
- Compares current pattern against database of historical patterns
- Learns from thousands of past pattern occurrences

**How it's calculated:**
1. Converts OHLCV data into sequences
2. Feeds through CNN layers to extract local features
3. LSTM layers capture temporal dependencies
4. Outputs probability score (0.00 - 1.00)

**What user sees:**
```
Score: 85.3%
Explanation: "CNN-LSTM neural network detected pattern with 85.3% 
confidence based on historical pattern matching across 50+ candles"
```

---

#### **Layer 2: Rule Validation Score (40% weight)**

**What it does:**
- Validates AI findings against classical technical analysis rules
- Checks RSI, MACD, EMA alignment, volume, price action
- Counts how many criteria the pattern meets

**How it's calculated:**
1. For **bullish patterns**, checks:
   - RSI < 50 (oversold/neutral) ‚Üí +10%
   - MACD > Signal (bullish crossover) ‚Üí +10%
   - Close > EMA9 (above short-term trend) ‚Üí +5%
   - Volume > 1.2√ó average ‚Üí +5%
   - Base score: 70%

2. For **bearish patterns**, checks:
   - RSI > 50 (overbought/neutral) ‚Üí +10%
   - MACD < Signal (bearish crossover) ‚Üí +10%
   - Close < EMA9 (below short-term trend) ‚Üí +5%
   - Volume > 1.2√ó average ‚Üí +5%
   - Base score: 70%

3. For **neutral patterns** (Doji, Spinning Top):
   - RSI between 30-70 ‚Üí +10%
   - Tight Bollinger Bands ‚Üí +10%
   - Base score: 70%

**What user sees:**
```
Score: 80.0%
Rules Passed: 4/5
Explanation: "Classical technical analysis rules validated pattern 
at 80.0% - pattern meets 4/5 criteria (RSI oversold, MACD bullish, 
high volume, above EMA9)"
```

---

#### **Layer 3: Context Score (20% weight)**

**What it does:**
- Analyzes current market conditions
- Evaluates volume, momentum, and trend strength
- Provides environmental context for the pattern

**How it's calculated:**
1. **Volume Score** (33% of context):
   - Current volume / 20-day average
   - Capped at 3.0√ó for extreme cases
   - Formula: `min(0.33, volume_ratio / 3.0)`

2. **Momentum Score** (33% of context):
   - Based on RSI distance from neutral (50)
   - Formula: `0.33 √ó (1 - abs(RSI - 50) / 50)`
   - Rewards RSI near extremes

3. **Trend Strength Score** (34% of context):
   - Based on ADX indicator
   - Strong trend (ADX > 25): Higher score
   - Weak trend (ADX < 25): Lower score
   - Formula: `min(0.34, ADX / 100)` if ADX > 25

**What user sees:**
```
Score: 82.0%
Explanation: "Market context analysis scored 82.0% based on 
volume (1.80), momentum (0.42), and trend strength (0.28)"
```

- **Momentum Score**: 0.42 (RSI at 42)
- **Trend Strength**: 0.28 (ADX at 28)
- **S/R Proximity**: 0.92 (very close to support/resistance)
- **Volatility (ATR)**: $2.45
- **Bollinger Band Position**: 0.35 (lower third of bands)
- **MACD Strength**: 0.15

---

#### **Layer 5: Risk Management**

**Automatically calculated based on ATR:**
- **Entry Price**: Current close price
- **Stop Loss**: Entry - (1.5 √ó ATR) for longs
- **Take Profit**: Entry + (2.0 √ó ATR) for longs
- **Risk/Reward Ratio**: 2.0 / 1.5 = 1.33x

**What user sees:**
```
Entry: $150.25
Stop Loss: $146.58 (1.5√ó ATR = $3.67)
Take Profit: $155.15 (2.0√ó ATR = $4.90)
R/R Ratio: 1.33x
