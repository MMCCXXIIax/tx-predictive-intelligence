## THE PROBLEM I LIVED

Back in 2022, I started trading. I quickly realized the problem wasn't the marketâ€”it was being human.

I watched myself and traders with millions of subscribers:
- Glued to screens for hours
- Missing trades while sleeping  
- Losing 80% of portfolios from a 12-minute nap
- Rushing to books to verify patterns

**This isn't just my pain. It's OUR pain. And no one is solving it.**
