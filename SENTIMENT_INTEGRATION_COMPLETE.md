## üîç What Sentiment Analysis Monitors

### **1. Financial News (40% of sentiment)**
**Sources:**
- Finnhub API (real-time company news)
- NewsAPI (breaking financial news)
- Yahoo Finance News (always available)

**What it analyzes:**
- Headlines and summaries from last 7 days
- Sentiment polarity (-1 to +1) using TextBlob NLP
- Counts positive, negative, and neutral articles
- Identifies trending keywords (earnings, revenue, merger, lawsuit, etc.)

**Example:**
```
Analyzed 15 news articles:
- 8 positive (bullish earnings, revenue beat)
- 3 negative (lawsuit concerns)
- 4 neutral
News Sentiment Score: 0.65 (BULLISH)
```

---

### **2. Social Media Sentiment (30% of sentiment)**
**Sources:**
- StockTwits API (trader sentiment)
- Reddit mentions (via Finnhub)
- Twitter/X sentiment (via Finnhub)
- Volume-based social interest estimation

**What it analyzes:**
- Mention count (how much people are talking about it)
- Social sentiment scores from platforms
- Volume ratio as proxy for social interest
- Trending discussions

**Example:**
```
Social Media Analysis:
- 2,847 mentions across platforms
- Reddit score: +42 (bullish)
- Twitter score: +38 (bullish)
- High volume = High social interest
Social Sentiment Score: 0.58 (MODERATE_BULLISH)
```

---

### **3. Market Sentiment (30% of sentiment)**
**Indicators:**
- **VIX (Fear Index)** - Market volatility/fear
- **S&P 500 Trend** - Overall market direction
- **Put/Call Ratio** - Options sentiment
- **Market Breadth** - Advancing vs declining stocks

**What it analyzes:**
- VIX < 15 = Low fear (bullish)
- VIX > 30 = High fear (bearish)
- SPY 5-day trend (market momentum)
- Sector rotation and strength

**Example:**
```
Market Sentiment Analysis:
- VIX: 14.2 (Low fear = Bullish)
- SPY 5-day change: +2.3% (Strong uptrend)
- Market regime: RISK_ON
Market Sentiment Score: 0.72 (BULLISH)
```

---

## üìä How Sentiment Affects Confidence

### **Formula:**
```
Overall Sentiment = 
  40% √ó News Sentiment
+ 30% √ó Social Sentiment  
+ 30% √ó Market Sentiment

Sentiment Score (for confidence) = (Overall Sentiment + 1) / 2
```

### **Example Calculation:**
```
News Sentiment: +0.65 (40% weight)
Social Sentiment: +0.58 (30% weight)
Market Sentiment: +0.72 (30% weight)

Overall Sentiment = (0.40 √ó 0.65) + (0.30 √ó 0.58) + (0.30 √ó 0.72)
                  = 0.26 + 0.174 + 0.216
                  = 0.65 (BULLISH)

Sentiment Score = (0.65 + 1) / 2 = 0.825 (82.5%)
```

## üéØ Sentiment Strength Levels

| Overall Sentiment | Strength | Impact on Confidence |
|------------------|----------|---------------------|
| > +0.5 | VERY_BULLISH | +12% to +15% |
| +0.2 to +0.5 | BULLISH | +5% to +12% |
| +0.05 to +0.2 | SLIGHTLY_BULLISH | +1% to +5% |
| -0.05 to +0.05 | NEUTRAL | 0% |
| -0.2 to -0.05 | SLIGHTLY_BEARISH | -1% to -5% |
| -0.5 to -0.2 | BEARISH | -5% to -12% |
| < -0.5 | VERY_BEARISH | -12% to -15% |
