## 🎯 What Changed Today

### 1. Error Tracking (Sentry)
```python
# Automatic error capture
# Privacy-safe (no PII)
# 10% trace sampling
# Flask integration
```

**Setup:**
```bash
export SENTRY_DSN="your-dsn-here"
export SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT="production"
```

### 2. Enhanced Health Monitoring
```bash
# New endpoint
GET /health/detailed

# Monitors:
✓ Database connectivity
✓ ML models (15+ models)
✓ Deep learning (PyTorch + CUDA)
✓ Online learning status
✓ System resources (CPU/RAM/Disk)
✓ Background workers
✓ Error tracking
```

### 3. Test Suite
```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# With coverage
pytest --cov=services --cov-report=html

# Tests:
✓ Health endpoints
✓ ML API validation
✓ Error handling
```

### 4. Dependencies
