```
üßµ I spent 6 months building an AI trading system that actually works.

Today, I'm launching the private beta.

Here's what makes it different (and why I'm giving away the first 20 spots for free)...
```

**Tweet 2/7:**
```
Most trading alerts are noise.

Pattern detected ‚Üí Alert fired ‚Üí 50/50 chance

TX is different. Every alert goes through 5 AI validation layers:
1. Rule-based detection
2. Deep learning (CNN-LSTM)
3. Multi-timeframe fusion
4. Sentiment analysis
5. Composite quality scoring
```

**Tweet 3/7:**
```
The result?

‚ùå Before: 55% win rate, 40% false positives
‚úÖ After: 75-85% win rate, 15% false positives

Only alerts that pass ALL 5 layers get the "ELITE" badge.

Those are the ones you trade.
```

**Tweet 4/7:**
```
Tech stack:
- Python + Flask backend
- PyTorch for deep learning
- PostgreSQL + PgBouncer
- Real-time sentiment from Twitter/Reddit/news
- Reinforcement learning (DQN) for timing

67 API endpoints. 9.0/10 backend quality.

Built for traders, by a trader.
```

**Tweet 5/7:**
```
What you get as a beta tester:

‚úÖ Free lifetime Pro access ($49/mo value)
‚úÖ Direct access to me (the founder)
‚úÖ Shape the product roadmap
‚úÖ Exclusive Discord community
‚úÖ First to see new features

What I need: Honest feedback. That's it.
```

**Tweet 6/7:**
```
Why free?

I need 20 smart traders to stress-test this before public launch.

You get an elite trading tool.
I get invaluable feedback.

Win-win.

(Also, I have $0 marketing budget üòÖ)
```

**Tweet 7/7:**
```
Want in?

DM me "BETA" and I'll send you access.

First 20 only. No credit card. No BS.

Let's build something great together.

**Title:** [Beta] Built an AI trading system with CNN-LSTM pattern detection - Looking for 10 testers

**Body:**
```
Hey r/algotrading,

I spent the last 6 months building a trading system that combines deep learning, multi-timeframe analysis, and sentiment integration.

Today I'm launching a private beta and looking for 10 experienced algo traders to help me stress-test it.

**What it does:**

1. **Deep Learning Pattern Detection**
   - CNN-LSTM neural network analyzes raw OHLCV sequences
   - Learns patterns from historical data (not hand-coded rules)
   - Detects 10 pattern types with confidence scores

2. **Multi-Timeframe Fusion**
   - Scores symbols across 1h, 4h, 1D simultaneously
   - Weighted ensemble with regime-adaptive weights
   - Detects timeframe divergence

3. **Sentiment Integration**
   - Real-time sentiment from Twitter, Reddit, news
   - 12 sentiment features integrated into ML pipeline

4. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - DQN agent for optimal entry/exit timing
   - Learns from experience, not just win/loss

5. **Online Learning**
   - Models update incrementally as new outcomes arrive
   - No need for full retraining

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Python + Flask (67 API endpoints)
- ML: PyTorch, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
- Database: PostgreSQL + PgBouncer
- Monitoring: Sentry + Prometheus

**What I'm offering:**
- Free lifetime Pro access (normally $49/mo)
- Direct access to me for questions/feedback
- Exclusive Discord community
- Shape the product roadmap

**What I need:**
- Use it for 2 weeks
- Report bugs
- Share honest feedback
- Optional: 15-min call

**Not selling anything.** Genuinely want feedback from experienced traders before public launch.

If interested, comment below or DM me. First 10 only.

Happy to answer any technical questions about the architecture.

#### Post 2: r/MachineLearning

**Title:** [Project] Built a trading system with CNN-LSTM + RL - Looking for feedback

**Body:**
```
Built a trading intelligence system that combines several ML techniques. Looking for feedback on the architecture.

**ML Components:**

1. **CNN-LSTM Hybrid for Pattern Detection**
   - Input: 50-candle OHLCV sequences
   - CNN extracts local features (support/resistance)
   - LSTM captures temporal dependencies
   - Attention mechanism for interpretability
   - Output: Multi-label probabilities for 10 pattern types

2. **Multi-Timeframe Ensemble**
   - Parallel scoring across 3 timeframes
   - Adaptive weighting based on market regime
   - Alignment score to detect consensus

3. **Reinforcement Learning (DQN)**
   - State: price, volume, indicators, sentiment, position
   - Actions: BUY, SELL, HOLD
   - Reward: PnL with patience/risk penalties
   - Experience replay + target network

4. **Online Learning**
   - Passive-Aggressive + SGD classifiers
   - Incremental updates as outcomes arrive
   - No full retraining needed

**Results (on historical data):**
- Win rate: 75-85% (vs 55-60% rule-based baseline)
- False positives: -60% reduction
- Adaptation: 10x faster with online learning

**Tech:**
- PyTorch for deep learning
- scikit-learn for ensemble models
- 40+ engineered features + raw OHLCV
- Handles imbalanced data with SMOTE

Launching private beta today. Looking for 10 people to test it.

Happy to discuss the architecture or share code snippets.

Thoughts? Suggestions for improvement?
