## 📊 Confidence Scoring - Complete Transparency

### HYBRID PRO Confidence Formula

```
Final Confidence = 
  40% × Deep Learning Score (CNN-LSTM pattern recognition)
+ 40% × Rule Validation Score (Classical TA alignment)
+ 20% × Context Score (Market conditions)
```

**5-Layer Breakdown Users See:**

**1️⃣ AI Deep Learning (40% weight)**
- CNN-LSTM neural network scans 50+ candles
- Learns from historical pattern database
- Score: 0.00 - 1.00
- Example: "CNN-LSTM detected pattern with 85.3% confidence based on historical pattern matching"

**2️⃣ Rule Validation (40% weight)**
- Validates against classical TA rules
- Checks RSI, MACD, EMA alignment, volume
- Shows rules passed (e.g., 4/5 criteria met)
- Example: "Pattern meets 4/5 classical TA criteria - RSI oversold, MACD bullish, high volume, above EMA"

**3️⃣ Market Context (20% weight)**
- Volume score (relative to 20-day average)
- Momentum score (RSI position)
- Trend strength (ADX indicator)
- Example: "Market context: Volume 1.8x average, RSI at 42 (neutral), ADX 28 (trending)"

**4️⃣ Quality Factors**
- Volume Score: 1.80
- Momentum Score: 0.42
- Trend Strength: 0.28
- S/R Proximity: 0.92 (near support)
