## üí≠ IT STARTED WITH A SIMPLE QUESTION

### "What if a tool could do the heavy lifting?"

**2022.** I was exploring business models‚ÄîSMMA, dropshipping, affiliate marketing. Then I discovered trading.

I thought I found my path. But I quickly realized something:

**Trading isn't hard because of the market. It's hard because we're human.**

I watched myself:
- Staring at screens for hours
- Rushing to my trading book to verify patterns
- Missing trades while sleeping
- Losing money not from lack of skill, but from human limitations

**Then I saw traders with millions of subscribers doing the same thing:**
- Glued to screens
- Missing opportunities
- Losing 80% of their portfolio from a 12-minute nap

**That's when it hit me:**

**This isn't just my pain. It's OUR pain.**

**And no one is truly solving it.**

The tools available:
- Drown us in endless data
- Demand months of study  
- Give us numbers without clarity
- Offer zero transparency into WHY

**I didn't just see a market opportunity.**

**I lived the problem. I felt the pain. I understood the losses.**

**So I built the solution that could finally benefit all of us.**

**That's how TX was born.**

## üéØ THE PROBLEM

### $5 Trillion Trading Industry Has a Trust Problem

**95% of AI trading platforms are black boxes:**
- Traders don't know WHY AI makes decisions
- No transparency = No trust = No adoption
- Retail traders lose $1.1B annually to bad signals
- Institutional tools cost $24k/year (Bloomberg)

**Current Solutions:**
- TradingView: Great charts, zero AI explanation
- Bloomberg: Expensive black box ($24k/year)
- Robinhood: No AI at all
- Others: "Trust us" with no reasoning

**The Gap:** Traders want AI power with human understanding.

## üë• THE TEAM

### Founder & CEO - The Origin Story

**Why I Built TX: From Trader's Pain to Founder's Mission**

Back in 2022, I was searching for the best business model to start. I explored SMMA, dropshipping, affiliate marketing‚Äîyou name it. Then I stumbled into trading and decided to give it a shot.

Along the way, I discovered that true mastery of trading comes down to just two things: **pattern knowledge and risk management.**

When I practiced on demo accounts, my process was always the same:
1. Analyze the charts
2. Rush to my trading book to check if the candlestick patterns matched
3. Set my stop-loss at -2%
4. Place my take-profit higher

If you trade, you know exactly what I mean.

**At first, I thought it was just me.**

But then I saw traders with **millions of YouTube subscribers** glued to their screens for hours waiting for patterns, missing trades, even losing 80% of their portfolio because of a 12-minute nap.

I thought, "Maybe that's just how trading is meant to be."

**But then I realized even professional traders were suffering the same problems‚Äînot because they lacked skills, but because they're human.**

That's when it hit me: **This isn't just my pain. It's OUR pain. And no one is truly solving it.**

The tools available:
- Drown us in endless data
- Demand months of study
- Give us numbers without clarity
- Offer no transparency into WHY

**I didn't just wake up one day and decide, "I'm going to build a tool." NO.**

**I lived the problem. I felt the pain. I understood the losses we all face.**

**And I built the solution that could finally benefit all of us.**

That's when I asked myself: **What if a tool could do the heavy lifting?**

**That's how TX was born.**

A tool that:
- Studies the market for you
- Scans patterns 24/7
- Watches opportunities you'd miss
- Explains every decision in plain English
- Makes trading smarter, not harder

**TX is designed not just for seasoned traders, but also for complete beginners who want to start their journey with confidence.**

**I built TX because I was tired of:**
- Staring at screens for hours
- Missing trades while sleeping
- Guessing what patterns mean
- Losing money to human limitations
- Using tools that don't explain themselves

**I built TX because traders deserve better.**

### Why This Matters for Investors

**This isn't a "saw a market opportunity" story.**

**This is a "felt the pain, lived the struggle, built the solution" story.**

The best founders solve problems they've personally experienced:
- Airbnb: Brian Chesky couldn't afford rent
- Uber: Travis Kalanick couldn't get a cab
- Dropbox: Drew Houston kept forgetting his USB drive

**TX: I was losing trades because I'm human, not superhuman.**

**I have:**
- ‚úÖ Deep empathy for the user (I AM the user)
- ‚úÖ Obsessive understanding of the problem
- ‚úÖ Technical skills to build the solution (9.5/10 backend solo)
- ‚úÖ Vision for the future (AR trading glasses)
- ‚úÖ Execution speed (shipped in 3 months)
- ‚úÖ Resilience (self-taught AI/ML while trading)
