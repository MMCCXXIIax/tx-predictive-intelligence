## Response to NOMOLABS CTO

### Recommended Reply
```
Appreciate the technical breakdown! You're right that raw OHLCV data 
is more efficient than chart images for ML.

We actually use a hybrid approach:
1. CNN-LSTM on raw OHLCV sequences (like you)
2. Multi-asset correlation analysis (relationships between assets)
3. Order flow imbalance detection (institutional footprints)
4. Market microstructure analysis (optimal entry times)
5. Regime-adaptive modeling (bull/bear/ranging/volatile)
6. Pattern recognition library (50+ proven patterns)
7. Real-time sentiment fusion (news + social + market)

The combination gives us both the ML power of raw data AND the 
explainability traders need (pattern names, historical win rates, 
sentiment context, regime-specific recommendations).

Different philosophies on the transparency vs. black-box spectrum, 
but both valid. Would be interesting to compare performance metrics 
once you're live.

What's your approach to explainability? Do you show users WHY the 
model predicts a certain direction, or just the prediction itself?
```

**This response:**
- ✅ Shows you understand their tech (credibility)
- ✅ Reveals you ALSO use raw data (competitive parity)
- ✅ Lists 7 layers you have (competitive superiority)
- ✅ Probes their weakness (explainability)
- ✅ Keeps relationship professional
