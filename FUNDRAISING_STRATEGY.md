Hi [Founder Friend],

Hope you're doing well! I'm raising a seed round for TX Predictive Intelligence‚Äîwe're building the world's first explainable AI trading platform (think "ChatGPT for trading" with full transparency).

We just launched our beta and hit 5k users in 2 weeks. I know you're connected to [VC Name] at [VC Firm]‚Äîwould you be open to making an intro?

Happy to share our one-pager first so you can see if it's a fit.

### Email Template 2: Cold Outreach (Last Resort)

**Subject:** TX: Explainable AI for Trading ($6M seed)

Hi [VC Name],

I'm [Your Name], founder of TX Predictive Intelligence. We're building the only AI trading platform that explains its decisions in plain English.

**The problem I lived:** As a trader, I watched myself and others with millions of subscribers lose money not from lack of skill, but from human limitations‚Äîstaring at screens for hours, missing trades while sleeping.

**Our solution:** 5-layer AI system that scans 24/7, detects patterns, and explains exactly why it recommends each trade. Think "ChatGPT for trading" but with full transparency.

**Traction:** Production-ready backend (9.5/10), 5k users in 2 weeks, 500 daily active.

**Vision:** Phase 2 is AR trading glasses‚Äîsee the market through AI's eyes.

**Raising:** $6-7M seed at $25M pre-money.

Would love 15 minutes to share our vision. Here's our one-pager: [Link]

Best,
[Your Name]

[Your Name]

**Start with emotion:**
"Back in 2022, I was exploring business models. I discovered trading and thought I found my path. But I quickly realized trading isn't hard because of the market‚Äîit's hard because we're human.

I watched myself staring at screens for hours, missing trades while sleeping, losing money not from lack of skill but from human limitations.

Then I saw traders with millions of subscribers doing the same thing‚Äîlosing 80% of their portfolio from a 12-minute nap.

That's when it hit me: This isn't just my pain. It's OUR pain. And no one is solving it.

So I built TX."

## üö® COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Don't:
1. ‚ùå Start fundraising too early (wait for traction)
2. ‚ùå Talk to too many VCs at once (creates noise)
3. ‚ùå Accept first term sheet (create competition)
4. ‚ùå Ignore red flags (bad investors are worse than no investors)
5. ‚ùå Over-optimize valuation (focus on partner quality)
6. ‚ùå Forget to ask for referrals (even if they pass)
7. ‚ùå Neglect product during fundraising (keep shipping)
8. ‚ùå Hide weaknesses (transparency builds trust)

### Do:
1. ‚úÖ Launch beta first (prove traction)
2. ‚úÖ Get warm intros (10x higher success rate)
3. ‚úÖ Create FOMO (multiple interested parties)
4. ‚úÖ Choose investors wisely (they're partners for 7+ years)
5. ‚úÖ Negotiate terms (not just valuation)
6. ‚úÖ Keep momentum (weekly updates to all VCs)
7. ‚úÖ Stay focused (fundraising is a sprint, not marathon)
8. ‚úÖ Celebrate wins (fundraising is hard!)

## üí° INSIDER TIPS

### From Successful Founders:

**1. The "Update Email" Strategy**
Send weekly updates to all VCs you've met:
- User growth
- New features shipped
- Press mentions
- Customer testimonials
- Other investor interest

**Creates FOMO and keeps you top of mind.**

---

**2. The "Soft Circle" Technique**
Before official term sheet, get soft commits:
"If we get a lead at $25M, would you commit $500k?"

**Helps you know who's serious.**

---

**3. The "Reference Check Reversal"**
Ask VCs for references to THEIR portfolio founders:
"Can I talk to 2-3 founders you've backed?"

**Filters out bad investors early.**

---

**4. The "Deadline" Close**
Set a soft deadline (2 weeks out):
"We're planning to close by [date] to start hiring."

**Forces decision-making.**

---

**5. The "Traction Bomb"**
